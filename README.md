# BackupOnEventPlugin
## A Minecraft plugin that backs up a server when an event is triggered
When backing up, the plugin will look for the default `world`, the `nether` and `the end`. It will only backup folders related to the `level-name` defined in the `server.properties` generated by the Minecraft server.

`config.yml` can backupEvents used to define which events trigger a backup and to control backup announcement or messages.

Backups can have a minimum time interval set, using the `minimumIntervalInMinutes` field, which prevents backups being triggered multiple times by different users within the defined time period. The `maxInMegaBytes` field defines the maximum amount of storage the plugin can use for backups. If this is exceeded the plugin will delete the oldest backup.

**Events that trigger a backup**:
  - Player join event
  - Player quit event
  - Player with correct permission executing `\backup` command

## Default config.yml
```yaml
# You can enable/disable the events that will trigger a backup to happen
# Messages and announcements can backupEvents hidden
# onJoin and onQuit will hide the 'x has joined the server' messages
# mustBeOpToUseCommand restricts the /backup command to ops only
# Setting maxInMegaBytes to 0 will provide unlimited space
# Setting minimumIntervalInMinutes to 0 will allow back to back backups
# AutoUpdate will download the latest version from bukkit.org when an Op joins the server
