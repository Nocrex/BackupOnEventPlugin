# BackupOnEventPlugin
### A Minecraft plugin that backs up a server when an event is triggered
When backing up, the plugin will look for the default `world`, the `nether` and `the end`. It will only backup folders related to the `level-name` defined in the `server.properties` generated by the Minecraft server.

`config.yml` can be used to define which events trigger a backup and to control backup announcement or messages.

Events which trigger a backup:
  - Player join event
  - Player quit event
